    <title>The Command Name</title>
    <shortdesc>A <ph conkeyref="definitions/product_name"/> command is formed by a backslash (\) and a series of letters.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <!--Use hazardstatement element for the warning below, instead? Is that too much?-->
        <p>A <ph conkeyref="definitions/product_name"/> command name cannot include numbers.</p>
        <p>Good practice is to use title case (TitleCase) for user-defined commands, to ensure that new command names do not conflict with command names that are already defined by <ph conkeyref="definitions/product_name"/>.</p>
